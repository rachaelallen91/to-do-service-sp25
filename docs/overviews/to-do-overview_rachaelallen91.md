# To-Do service overview

The To-Do Service API is a mock RESTful API that simulates a cloud-based task management system. It supports basic operations for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting to-do items, as well as managing users.

This service is for developers and technical writing students who want to practice working with APIs and documenting common resource interactions.

## Key features

- Create and manage to-do tasks
- Associate tasks with users
- Retrieve individual tasks or lists of tasks
- Change or delete existing tasks

## Primary resources

- `/tasks`: Represents individual to-do items, including details like title, description, and completion status
- `/users`: Represents users who can create and own tasks

## Common use cases

- Build a basic to-do list app using mock data
- Practice documenting REST API endpoints and responses
- Test the serivice's operations without a production backend
